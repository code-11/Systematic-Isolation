Systematic Isolation is a playlist to text extractor for youtube. It will make a file containing the names of all your playlist's songs. It will not sort them in any way. It doesn't handle apostrophes well. It is implemented very poorly. Don't expect it to work if youtube updates their page. Don't expect it to work on mac or linux. Just don't expect it to work period.

It is used by:
1. Going to your playlist on youtube
2. Copying the URL
3. Paste it into the source code where it says YOUR PLAYLIST URL HERE
4. Run it 
5. It will create a text file called playlist.txt.
6. If there is already a playlist.txt, it will override it. Thus, move it/rename it when you are done.
